A summary of the main AI models used in the Janus Defi Protocol.

Janus is a novel yieldcoin protocol that unites AI-driven yield optimization with the tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs). In an evolving crypto landscape dominated by volatility and centralization, Janus introduces a Dynamic Value Token system powered by JanusAI—an autonomous engine that intelligently manages fees, rewards, and DeFi strategies to maintain price stability and optimize returns.

At its core, Janus features:

•	A dual-token architecture (Alpha & Omega) that enables smooth price appreciation to beat inflation and reduced volatility.

•	JanusAI, which dynamically rebalances asset baskets, sets price targets, and allocates yield across crypto and tokenized real-world assets.

•	Hedgecoins, custom stable assets backed by diversified, uncorrelated collateral baskets, offering exposure with reduced risk.

•	Flatcoin Factory – A decentralized toolkit that allows users to mint custom inflation-resistant flatcoins, backed by diversified collateral and governed by AI-optimized monetary 
policies. This enables tailored digital currencies for DAOs, local economies, or specific use cases—powered by the Janus stabilization engine.

Positioned as a cutting-edge yieldcoin and stability layer, Janus empowers users to earn sustainable yield while bridging DeFi with real-world financial systems.
